### Learning Goals

- Understand the Agent-Environment interface
- Understand what MDPs (Markov Decision Processes) are and how to interpret transition diagrams
- Understand Value Functions, Action-Value Functions, and Policy Functions
- Understand the Bellman Equations and Bellman Optimality Equations for value functions and action-value functions
